# Meow Mountain

The spirit cat, protector of the valley and guardian of Meow Mountain, took a slightly too long nap. In that time, the valley fell into disarray - the protective barrier keeping evil spirits at bay has collapsed, and the weary villagers have stopped worshiping their feline protector. Can you restore peace to Whiskerâ€™s Valley?
