# Game mechanics

## The player

The player is a witch that lives alone in a house atop a hill. The witch also takes care of the people in the valley around the mountain.

The player is able to transform into a cat. This is so that the villagers are not immediately afraid of the witch.

The player is able to use spells to move around the map, perform tasks, help villagers and defend the valley.

### Player actions

## The map

The map is a grid. The game map is a thick forest with a few paths and clearings in it. In the center of the map is a clearing with a single house, where the main character lives. In other clearings there are small villages with a few houses and residents.

## The villagers

Each villager has a little routine. They live in a house, from where they exit in the morning, then walk around a fixed route, before coming back home in the evening.

The villagers are very supersticious. They will grow weary of the black cat wandering around the forest. If they become very afraid, they will try to capture and kill the cat.

## The main quest

To save the valley, we must collect special items from aroung the map. These items are hidden, but can be revealed by using a spell while the player is near them. Once all items are collected, a new barrier spell can be cast on the peak to save the valley.

## Side quests

There are random quests that will grand the player magical power, which will be needed to cast bigger spells. Example side quests:

## Level 1 quests

Level 1 quests are tiny tasks that can be done each day and grant a little favour from the villagers.

- Heal a withering farm field
- Heal a sick villager
- Scare away pests from the farm

## Level 2 quests

Level 2 quests are more involved and provide a small amount of favour every day

- Brew a protection potion using ingredients and place it on a house
- Reveal a hidden shortcut between villages
