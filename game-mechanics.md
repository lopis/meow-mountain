# Game mechanics

## The player

The player is a witch that lives alone in a house atop a hill. The witch also takes care of the people in the valley around the mountain.

The player is able to transform into a cat. This is so that the villagers are not immediately afraid of the witch.

The player is able to use spells to move around the map, perform tasks, help villagers and defend the valley.

## The map

The map is a grid. The game map is a thick forest with a few paths and clearings in it. In the center of the map is a clearing with a single house, where the main character lives. In other clearings there are small villages with a few houses and residents.

## The villagers

Each villager has a little routine. They live in a house, from where they exit in the morning, then walk around a fixed route, before coming back home in the evening.

The villagers are very supersticious. They will grow weary of the black cat wandering around the forest. If they become very afraid, they will try to capture and kill the cat.
