# Game mechanics

## The player

The player is a cat spirit that lives alone in a house atop a hill. The cat also takes care of the people in the valley around the mountain.

The player can take a human form but this would alert the residents of the valley who would attack the player. So moving around in cat form is much more discreet.

The player is able to use spells to move around the map, perform tasks, help villagers and defend the valley.

### Player actions

- Run: move around the map in empty areas
- Sneak: hide near the trees so you're not seen
- Meow: call for attention of people nearby
- Scratch: cast a magical physical attack
- Collect: collect at item
- Conjure: call a collected item back
- Transform: transform between cat and human forms via the portal

## The map

The map is a grid. The game map is a thick forest with a few paths and clearings in it. In the center of the map is a clearing with a single house, where the main character lives. In other clearings there are small villages with a few houses and residents.

The cat fell asleep and the valley fell into disarray. Evil spirits roam the forest and torment the villagers.

## The villagers

Each villager has a little routine. They live in a house, from where they exit in the morning, then walk around a fixed route, before coming back home in the evening.

The villagers are very supersticious. They will grow weary of the black cat wandering around the forest when they see it repeatidly. If they become very afraid, surpersticion levels will grow, leading to evil spirits appearing in the forest.

## The evil spirits

Evil spirits start spawing once supersticion levels grow too much. Direct contact with evil spirits causes damage to the cat and villagers.

## The main quest

To save the valley, we must collect special items from aroung the map. These items are hidden, but can be revealed by using a spell while the player is near them. Once all items are collected, a new barrier spell can be cast on the peak to save the valley.

## Side quests

There are random quests that will grand the player magical power, which will be needed to cast bigger spells. Example side quests:

## Level 1 quests

Level 1 quests are tiny tasks that can be done each day and grant a little favour from the villagers.

- Heal a withering farm field
- Heal a sick villager
- Scare away pests from the farm

## Level 2 quests

Level 2 quests are more involved and provide a small amount of favour every day

- Brew a protection potion using ingredients and place it on a house
- Reveal a hidden shortcut between villages
- Defeat a wave of evil spirits
